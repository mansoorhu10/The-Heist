# The-Heist
This is a project I made for a computer science culminating. It is a choose-your-own style text adventure game that involves many options that affect how the story progresses. It involves lots of if statements, while loops, functions and overall serves as an amazing example of the concepts that I learned in ICS 3U1 using python.
